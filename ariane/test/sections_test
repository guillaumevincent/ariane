[code_status]
400 = Bad input parameter. Error message should indicate which one and why.
401 = Bad or expired token. This can happen if the user or CSI-web revoked or expired an access token. To fix, you should re-authenticate the user.
403 = Bad OAuth request (wrong consumer key, bad nonce, expired timestamp...). Unfortunately, re-authenticating the user won't help here.
404 = File or folder not found at the specified path.
405 = Request method not expected (generally should be GET or POST).
503 = Your app is making too many requests and is being rate limited. 503s can trigger on a per-app or per-user basis.
5xx = Server error.
